# Step2Rythym
An app to search for related artists and lyrics to your new favorite songs!

## How this works:
Users can utilize this app to:
(1) Put in artist+song name to find the song lyrics
(2) Type in a snippet of a song lyric to find the song. Example search: "Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine". Example result: Mr. Brightside by The Killers

## Website set-up:
(1) Upper portion: Search bar, where user can use criterias "Artist's Name", "Song Name", or "Song Lyric Snippet" to search for "Song". Criteria will be inline with search bar& "Go" button.
(2) Lower portion:: Where the search result will go. Header will say: "Showing searches for "(Artist's Name/Song Name/Song Lyric Snippet)". Body of the column will be matched songs/song lyrics

## Goals for added features:
(1) Logo
(2) Landing page, with header, and then bottom for search bar

## Steps to build this page:
(1) create html
(2) create js
(3) create stylesheet


## Second page would include:
(1) Div to include the header
(2) Div to include the song name& artist
(3) Div for album art
(4) Div for song lyrics
(5) Div for song suggestions
